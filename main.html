	<ul>
		<li>People with cognitive disabilities can better understand the form and how to complete it, as making forms accessible improves the layout structure and feedback.</li>
		<li>People using speech input can use the labels via voice commands to activate controls and move the focus to the fields that they have to complete.</li>
		<li>People with limited dexterity benefit from large clickable areas that include the labels, especially for smaller controls, such as radio buttons and checkboxes.</li>
